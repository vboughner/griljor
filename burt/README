 * Burt - an eliza-like response program
 * A first project in C by Van A. Boughner - May 1989

 **************************************************************************/

This code may be used and modified as long as this notice remains intact
and no monetary gain is taken through the use of this code.  The Burt
program is based on the idea behind the Eliza program found in the
"More Computer Games" book published some time ago.  Burt parses sentences
like the Eliza program did, but goes a step furthur in providing a way
for Burt to know the answers to particular questions or give specific
responses through the use of a couple key words.

To use Burt, do the following:

1) type 'make testburt'

2) once compilation is complete, try 'testburt speech.text'

3) modify Burt's responses yourself by changing the 'speech.text' file.

4) you may add Burt to another program through calls of the
   set_personality(num, filename) and query_personality(num, s) functions.
   The testburt.c file shows how you would do this in your code.
   For inclusion in your own code, you need the following files:
	main.c
	io.c
	load.c
	person.c
	response.c


Caveats: this was my first large C program.  I consider it a miracle that
   it works.  I hope it works for you but can't give any guarantees :-)
   Burt is currently being used to emulate a GM in the Griljor game program
   I'm working on.  You can see the responses in use for that game in the
   file 'gm.text'
