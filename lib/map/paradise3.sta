# This is the object placement startup file for the Player's Paradise 3 map.
#
# Each line in this file signifies one random placement action that will
# occur at the beginning of the game before any player is allowed to join.
# This allows for a certain amount of randomness to the map.  The
# placement of objects takes place room by room or team by team.
#
# The first character on each line is a t for placing something in a certain
# team's rooms, or an r for placing something on a certain room.
#
# Next in each lines comes the object number, and the quantity.
# Finally, the last entry on each line is the team number (0-4, 0 is neutral),
# or the room number (depending on whether r or t was used for first entry).
#
# Each line's entries must be separated by whitespace, like the following:
# t/r  	objnum	quant   team#/room#
#
# 3 frap guns in the game, one for each team, and one on neutral ground:
t	190	1	0
t	190	1	1
t	190	1	2
# 30 magazines of machine gun bullets for each team
t	183	30	0
t	183	30	1
t	183	30	2
# 5 large grenades apiece
t	202	5	0
t	202	5	1
t	202	5	2
