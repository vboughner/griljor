Processes of change when adding things to gameperson records:

1. Change structure in person.h to include new variable.
   When you compile new version, you must compile both griljor and grildriver
   The two will not work with each other if you only recompile one of them.

2. Add initializations of these variables to initialize_game_person()

3. Add variable to print_game_person() if you want to see it when you list
   gameperson values.

4. Add variable to MiniPerson structure and MY_INFO packet structure
   in socket.h

5. In person.c add of stats driver should keep in his gameperson array:
   if the variable you have added is one that the driver should keep on
   record about you, change miniperson_to_gameperson() to get the var
   out of DriverPack and into his gameperson list.

6. In person.c add your variable to prepare_driver_packet() if it is one
   that you should tell him about in the beginning, the place you'll actually
   add it is probably load_person_into_driver_pack()
   Even if it something he dictates to you later, you should probably put
   in a default value here.

7. Once the driver has talked to a new player, the player loads the info
   about himself and sorts it in move_pack_to_persons() in socket.c
   Add your variable to the sorting if it's info player needs.

8. Add a tranfer of your variable to/from packets in prepare_my_info()
   and notice_added_info() in socket.c

9. if it is a variable to be saved in password file you'll need to change
   notify_of_stats() and notice_save_stats() in socket.c

10.if the variable was put into the PlayerInfo structure (probably wasn't)
   then you'll need to make an addition to load_player_into_person() in
   play.c and the same sort of addition to load_monsters_into_persons()
   in language.c
