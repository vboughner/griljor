Provisional Griljor Documentation

Griljor is a multiplayer game written by Van A. Boughner, Mel Nicholson,
and Albert C. Baker III.  We started in October 1989 and it is a continuing
project.


			STARTING THE GAME

To start a game senario execute the grildriver program in the background.
The driver program is responsible for accepting new players and causes very
little load on the machine where it is run.

When you type 'grildriver' you start up a game with the default map.
If you want to play on some other map, use the following syntax:
	grildriver -m filename &
Look in sub directories of the game directory for some other maps,
currently 'contribmap' and 'map' directories contain some others.

To enter the game run the "griljor" program.  This is the player's front end
into the game, which is driven by internet data packets sent between players.

Major Note: You might have to kill your window manager in order for griljor
  	    to work right.  The symtoms of window manager interference are
	    readily apparent:  clicking the mouse will be ineffectual.


			PERSONALIZING YOUR CHARACTER

You may make for yourself a 32x32 bitmap representing how you wish to look.
You should also make a blacking mask that will erase space on the floor around
and underneath you before your image is drawn.  To join the game using the
bitmap and mask you have created, specify the filenames of the two bitmaps:
	griljor -b bitmap_file -bm mask_file
or if you do not wish to make a mask, a pretty good one will be made for you
if you specify only a bitmap, like this:
	griljor -b bitmap_file
You may use a ~ character in specifying the path to the bitmap file.
I suggest you make an alias out of this so that it is easy to use all the
time.  It will difficult to tell who you are on the screen if you look just
like everyone else.  Once you have used this bitmap with a certain character,
you no longer need to specify the bitmap file when you play.  The bitmap
and its mask are stored for you in our password file.

			INVERSE VIDEO OPTION

If you'd like the griljor window in black on white mode, add -r to the
command line when you run griljor.


			TIPS FOR BEGINNERS

When you first log into the game, practice moving around.  If you start in
the middle of a battle (as is often the case) FLEE!  You always start unarmed,
and many of the other players may have weapons.

Next try picking things up and moving them between your hands and inventory.
(see MOUSE CONTROLS and KEY CONTROLS)  Once you have the idea, start trying
to experiment with as many objects as you can get (remember to dodge, this is
a dangerous world) and find out what they do (see USES OF OBJECTS)

Beginners should feel free to experiement.  There is no lasting harm to
your character's statistics for being pummelled in the beginning.


			OBJECT OF THE GAME

Team Games: In a team game, the main object is to get all the flags and bring
them to your team base (the room you start in if you belong to a team).  The
winners recieve a large bonus for being on the winning team, and the others
recieve a smaller bonus for staying to the end of the game.  The player who
drops the last flag receives another bonus if he belongs to the winning team
or is neutral.  Winning for the oposing team recieves no bonus.  NOTE: the
"flags" are often represented as money bags or other valueables.

Free-for-all games: Kill, maim, hurt, damage, anihilate, and survive.

			INDIVIDUAL STATUS

Levels: As you rise in levels, you will gain hit points, magic points (not
currently used), and will heal faster.  Your level starts at one for each
game and increases for every 1000 experience points.  Experiance points are
gained for killing people who do not belong to your team, and lost for being
killed.  The experience gained or lost is greater if a low level player kills
a high level player, and lesser whenever the opposite situation occurs.

Rankings: Your ranking is an indication of how well you have played from
game to game.  Your ranking will increase or decrease according to team game
results and how well you do relative to other players.

				DEATH

When you are killed, all your possessions are dropped around you.  A few
seconds later, you will be reborn.  Now would be a good time to find a new
weapon or two . . .


			   USES OF OBJECTS


Preface: see MOUSE CONTROLS for info on how to "use" an object.

Weapons: Weapons are for hurting and killing your opponents.  Place the
mouse pointer to where you want the shot/swing/whatever to go when firing.

Ammo: batteries, clips, et cetera may be used to reload a weapon (et al)
Hold the weapon in one hand, the ammo in the other.  Use the ammo with
the mouse, and the weapon (or other recharable object) will be reloaded
iff this is the correct type of ammo.

Healing: Certain objects (like food) will heal you when you use them.

Keys: Stand next to a door and position the cursor on it, then use the key.

Others: Try them and find out . . .

			MOUSE CONTROLS

What mouse buttons do for you with cursor in world display window:
	Left button:	uses the object in left hand toward cursor position
	Middle button:	uses the object in right hand  "      "       "
	Right button:	starts you moving toward current cursor position,
			unless you aren't moving and you click it on your
			present position, it then results in an object
			on floor beneath you being taken into inventory.
	Shift & Left button:	takes object from floor into left hand
	Shift & Middle button:	takes object from floor into right hand

What mouse buttons do for you with cursor in inventory window:
	Left button:	swap inventory item with left hand contents
	Middle button:	 "       "      "    "   right hand    "
	Right button:	drop inventory item onto floor beneath you

What mouse buttons do for you in ANY message window:
	All:		nothing.  You may type messages while cursor
			is in any of the message windows.  First type the 
                        number or first word in name, then a space, then 
                        message.

			Sending a message to 'all' will make everyone see
			the message, sending a message to 'room' will make
			only the people in the room see your message, sending
			a message to 'gm' will invoke a somewhat entertaining
			response.


			 KEYBOARD CONTROLS

Movement Keys: These keys allow you to move while reserving the mouse for
	       other important tasks.

	p:		see list of other players in game
	o:		outline players to make them more visible
			  (allies are marked differently than opponents)
	t:		take object on floor beneath you
	q:		start a 4 second quitting sequence
				(any input will abort it)
	#:		drop everything you have onto the floor
	^:		reset you statistics to level 1 (only a good idea
			if you are nearing level 4 but don't wish to have
			you ranking re-evaluated).
	?:		toggle the display of the on-line help window

There will be more documentation later, have fun.  Van and Mel.
