Changes to current properties:

: ignoring, vulnerable, piercing, and destroys should be type bitmasks
  not booleans.
: damage and speed are changed to be noted from in the missile itself.
: absorb becomes percentage of shot that will be absorbed
: messages associated with the objects will have to be kept as some sort
  of linked list at the end of the object file.  Obtor may be made to make it
  easy for the object editing type person to see and alter these messages
  without too much trouble.  Substitution arguments should be allowed in
  these messages, to allow them to include user and victim names, room
  names, player level, etc.
: flashlight becomes a short, in order to allow it to hold the radius of light.
: override is a bitfield now
	

Flags not currently being used in correct form:
(whose name will be changed)
	armor	   (boolean)    autotaken
	thrown	   (boolean)	intohand
	pushable   (boolean)	unswitchable
	restorable (boolean)	autoactor
	restored   (value)	autodelay
