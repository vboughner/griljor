Processes of change when adding things to password file records:

1. change structure in password.h
   If you don't use part of the pad space you'll have to erase current
   password file.

2. If the driver should be transferring this data to person arrays when
   player logs on, then make an addition to copy_passinfo_into_person()
   in accept.c

3. If driver should be letting the player know about this item then
   make an addition to pickup_saved_person_info() in accept.c

4. If this is an item that should be saved in the stats during the game,
   make additions to SAVE_STATS structure in socket.h and change
   notify_of_stats() and notice_save_stats() in socket.c
   Any item that is ultimately changed at any time during the game must have
   an entry in notice_save_stats()

5. If it is an item that should be saved only at account creation time
   then make those changes to add_new_persons() in accept.c
   You'll probably want to add it to this routine in any case.
