Stuff to save for Version 2
==================================
MEL: Monsters: monster_main.c monster.c language.h language.c

VAN: command packet sending
VAN: change item storage to allow depth of 4 objects, eliminate the
     difference on squares for recorded objects, and make object number
     storage a short (2 bytes).  Recorded objects would still have a list,
     but we wouldn't have to search it all the time when drawing.
VAN: DELEGATE: make a program to translate old maps to new format.


Things to include in Version 1
===================================

TREVOR: how do you get rid of a mask for an object once you've given it one?
TREVOR: docs for obtor

VAN: make (are you sure?) for reset stats
VAN: no initial flicker of other players when entering room
VAN: check flag stability with more than two teams
VAN: change debugging to a command line option
VAN: Fix click buffer and cut buffer in editmap to handle recorded objects
VAN: DELEGATE: write complete documentation for playing griljor
VAN: allow maps to have a help file, giving the object of the game.
VAN: DELEGATE: write docs for editmap
VAN: make game joining and leaving more robust
VAN: give replace_request() ability to delete requests made useless
by opposing calls. (queued.c)
VAN: add things into driver and editmap to delete or ignore objects
that have invalid numbers (too large) in the map.  Also objects that were
recorded or not, but have changed, should be handled right in editmap.
Driver should create default records.
VAN: look through room drawing code for inconsistencies
VAN: make griljor do less busy waiting in the front page stage.
VAN: make missiles use the draw queue.  Make queue more intelligent.
VAN: put damage missile do in the packet rather than letting victim
     look up the object's damage
