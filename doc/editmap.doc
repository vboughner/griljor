			Griljor Map Editor


Purpose and Overview

	Griljor, is a highly flexible game environment.  The map editing
program allows the creation of a large number of different senarios.  The
map editor gives the designer control of the number of rooms in the map,
their contents, and the manner in which they are connected.  He may also
specify which library of objects is to be used with the map, thus
controlling the choice of objects and their properties.  The actual creation
and altering of the object definition libraries is left to another program,
the object editor.  Nevertheless, the map designer is also permitted to
select various options which control the way the map is played.  All these
things will be covered in their relevant sections in this text.


Responsibilities of a Map Maker

	The look and feel of Griljor is largely up to the object and map
designers.  The task of making a balanced, fun-to-play play map is not an
easy one.  Few maps will work well without any revision.  Be prepared to
take the time necessary to develop a map that will be both fair and fun.


Rooms and Map Subdivision

	A Griljor map is made up of any number of rooms.  The only
limitation is disk space and playability.  Maps that are too large are
difficult to play on.  Disk space isn't too much of a problem, however, each
room requires only 1K of storage space.  Each room is a completely
independent unit.  You are not required to make the room fit into any
reasonable view of reality if you don't wish to.  Indeed, you may connect
the four sides of the room to the corresponding opposite sides of any other
rooms on the map that you choose.  Inside each room, you can use exit
objects to simulate entrances to buildings, caves, elevators, pits, or
anything you like.  The size of each room is 20x20 squares, for a total of
400 individual locations inside the room.  Each square may contain several
objects stacked on top of each other and is just large enough to contain
a player's character in the game.  Player's move incrementally from square
to square in any of the eight directions.


The Point of it All

	To make a map that is fun to play, the designer needs a good idea of
the theme of the map and the size of game he wishes to accomodate.  Small
maps of about 4 rooms are good for anywhere from 2 to 8 players.  If there
is plenty of ammunition, they can even make a good game for larger groups
(although the scene is likely to be a bit bloody).  Care needs to be taken
in creating maps.  There is so much lattitude given to map (and object
definition) makers, that the game can be ruined easily by imbalancing or
ridiculous senarios.  It is the responsibility of the map maker to provide a
map that will be interesting, balanced, and not biased against beginners OR
experts.  For example, providing a large number of 'instant death' weapons
removes the need for skill in the game.  Players with the weopons simply
wait for someone to come along and kill them with one shot.  Ideally,
surprise should be an advantage for the atacker, but it should still be
possible for a skilled player to survive the attack or even kill the
ambusher.


Map Editor

	A program has been provided to help you create and edit maps.  It
will probably be available where the other Griljor program executables are
stored, under the name 'editmap'.  To start a new map using the default
object set, type 'editmap mapfile', where mapfile will be the filename of
the new map you are creating.  Be sure to be in a directory where you have
write permission when you do this.  To use an object set of your own design,
type 'editmap mapfile objectfile', where objectfile is the full absolute
pathname of the object file you wish to use.  To edit a map that you've
already created, just type 'editmap mapfile', you need not specify the
object file to use after the initial creation (unless you'd like to switch
to a different one).

	The editor will popup displaying the first room in the new map on
the left, and object set on the right.  A third window, underneath the room
display contains the name of the map, the room, the team that owns the room,
and a picture of a mouse (not of the squeaky variety).


Room Window

	The upper left window is a display of the current room you are
editing.  Each room consists of 400 squares, 20 across, and 20 high.  Each
square may contain up to three objects (two normal ones and one 'recorded'
one).  The room number is displayed in the lower left window, along with the
name of the room right below it.  You can easily change the room name by
clicking the mouse on the name itself, and you can select another room by
clicking on the room number line.


Object Window

	The right window contains the object set you have to work with.  The
window itself contains up to 196 objects.  If there are more than 196
objects in the set, then a set of scrolling buttons will appear at the top
of the window.  The left two buttons, when you click the mouse on them,
cause the object set window to scroll line by line.  The right two buttons
cause the window to scroll page by page, until the end is reached.


Stat Window

	The bottom left window contains the name of the map and room.  You
may change either of these by clicking the mouse on the name itself.  Also,
the name of the team that owns the current room is displayed below the room
name.  You may change the name of a team by clicking on that team's name when
you see it displayed as the owner of a room.  You may not, however, change
'neutral' to anything else.  On the right side of the window, there is a
picture of a 'mouse' with 3 buttons on it.  Each of the button spaces
represents a buffer where you may store objects from the object set.  The
picture of the object stored in each buffer will be displayed there in the
mouse picture.  When you start up the map editor, there will be nothing in
the buffers.  Occasionally, text will appear at the bottom of the stat
window, and often you will be required to enter text strings there (when,
for example, you desire to change the name of the map).  A 'linking' symbol
will appear in the mouse icon, by the way, whenever you use one-way or
two-way linking commands.  The link symbol will display which room the link
is originating from.


Help Window

	You can toggle the presence of the help window by pressing the '?'
key.  The help window gives a one-liner reminder of the function of each
keyboard key.  More elaborate explainations of the functions will be given
below.


Mouse Buttons

	The mouse is used mainly for placing objects in the room and for
specifying the location for some of the point specific keyboard functions.
The operation of the mouse is different in each of the main windows.  When
in the object window, pressing a mouse button while the cursor is on a
particular object will place the object in the mouse picture in the status
window and store it in the click buffer.  When in the room window, pressing
that same mouse button will cause the object in the click buffer to be
placed in the map at the point where the cursor is positioned.  This is the
main mechanism you use for building up the rooms in the map.  You can grab
up to three different objects at a time from the object window (by putting
them in the mouse click buffer), and then move the cursor over to the room
window and put any of those three objects down whereever you like.  As an
additional bonus, you can pick up objects from the room window as well, if
you hold down the shift key while pressing the button.

	In the status window, there are several places you can click the
mouse button to do something.  You may click on the map or room name to
change it.  And you may click on the room number to select a different room
to look at.  When a particular team own a room and you'd like to change the
spelling of their name, you can even do that by clicking on it (except that
you cannot change the name for neutrals.)
