2) Objects need to explode with the boombit as object, and not with 
    the boombit objects moving object.
3) The hurt-owner system needs to be fixed.

missile.c changed so that it calculates the move-onto priority differently
missile.c changed so that it explosions are NOT marked as special.  
    (hardcoded TRUE changed to hardcoded FALSE)
missile.c changed so that the radius of an explosion is one less than 
	the explodes field.
missile.c changed so that hurt-owner is always set to true
